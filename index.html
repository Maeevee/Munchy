            <h1>Control flow on Javascript</h1>
            <p>One of the most famous poets from Portugal has a sentence that is: “Primeiro estranha-se,depois entranha-se”, that in English is something like first it feels weird but then you feel it in you. That has been my experience with Javascript since the beginning. It started something that just felt weird but with time, it got on me and now I just want to know more and more and practice more and more.
                That being said I decided to write posts about Javascript topics. By writing it here I learn it better and you will also find something useful out of it. Because I am a code newbie and mostly I write these posts for other code newbies it might be that some things seem easy, even for me and you, but it just to get a ground start and to not jump over bit subjects in a topic.
                The first one of this long series is going to be about Control flow in Javascript.
                Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless of course in the code there is some instructions or statements that changes that control flow.
                The most known control flow used I would think is the if statement that we used many of our code. For example, you want a website to show some page if you are older than 18, if not, the website would render a different page is a traditional example of a control flow/ conditional example
                NOTE: Loops are a big part of control flow statement but because I want to write a post only about loops, even that I am going to mention and use them on the examples it will not be my main focus.</p>
                <h2>The Tang Dynasty Analysis Essay</h2>
                <p>The Tang dynasty started ruling China from 618 up to 907. Besides establishing stable government emperors, the Tang dynasty promoted religious beliefs among the Chinese people. Among the successful religion was Buddhism where different factors underscore the prosperity of this religion during the Tang Dynasty.First, the Tang Empire established policies that encouraged religious people to assimilate non-religious ones. Secondly, the emperors exempted the Buddhist monks from taxation, which promoted the flourishing of the religion by more people joining the monasteries.

                    Additionally, Empress Wu fought other religions except Buddhism and as citizens moved towards national unity, the success of Buddhism soared. However, when the number of monks increased, emperor Tang Wu Zong destroyed their temples forcing the monks to start laboring and this phenomenon underlines the rapid lasting decline of Buddhism at that time.
                    
                    The leaders of Yuan Dynasty used wars to conquer all the ethnic tribes in China by enforcing the dynastys governance; for instance, Emperor Shinzu used military services and possessed all the territories in China.
                    
                    The Yuan leaders used force to combine both Chinese and Mongol ruling system to establish social caste system, which gave the ruling class powers. As a result, the Chinese people possessed the lowest classes.
                    
                    The major strength of the combined system was the ability of the leaders to unite all the ethnic groups and acquisition of efficient military services. However, the rulers promoted corruption and social discrimination, which led to the fall of the Yuan dynasty.
